# GPA-Calculator
A python program that can calculate your expected GPA for the semester and can combine it with your overall GPA if you choose to

The above link is an idea of what the code for the calculator itself will look like. 

We will use the following source for how to export the information into an excel sheet:

The program itself will initialize by asking the user if they would like to add their current GPA.

If yes, the user will add their total earned credit hours and GPA. Then they will enter what their current semester classes are, credit hours for each class, and expected grade.

If no, the user will enter what their current semester classes are, credit hours for each class, and expected grade.

They will then get a display of what the semester GPA is and expected overall GPA. The system will give them an option to export to excel which if chosen, will export one of two
excel sheets depending on whether or not they provided their current GPA.
